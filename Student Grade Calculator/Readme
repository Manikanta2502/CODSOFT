# Student Grade Calculator README

This README provides instructions on how to run the Student Grade Calculator application, which calculates grades based on student scores. The main file to run is `Gradecal.java`, located at `Student Grade Calculator/src/Gradecal.java`. We recommend using Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) such as Eclipse or NetBeans for a smoother experience.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your computer.
- An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse or NetBeans installed.

## Steps to Run the Student Grade Calculator

Follow these steps to run the Student Grade Calculator using an IDE like Eclipse or NetBeans:

### Using Eclipse:

1. **Download the Source Code**: If you haven't already, download the source code for the Student Grade Calculator application from the project repository or source provided.

2. **Open Eclipse**: Launch Eclipse IDE.

3. **Import the Project**: In Eclipse, go to `File > Import...`. In the import wizard, select `General > Existing Projects into Workspace` and click `Next`.

4. **Select the Project**: Click on `Select root directory` and browse to the directory where you downloaded the source code. Select the project folder containing `Gradecal.java`. Click `Finish`.

5. **Build the Project**: Eclipse will automatically build the project. Ensure there are no compilation errors.

6. **Run the Application**: Right-click on `Gradecal.java` in the Project Explorer, and select `Run As > Java Application`. The application should now start, and you can interact with it through the IDE.

7. **Follow On-screen Instructions**: Depending on the Grade Calculator's design, follow the on-screen instructions to use the application. You can input student scores and calculate grades.

8. **Review the Code**: For a deeper understanding of how the Grade Calculator works, feel free to review the source code in `Gradecal.java` and any other relevant files in the project.

### Using NetBeans:
