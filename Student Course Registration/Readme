# Student Course Registration README

This README provides instructions on how to run the Student Course Registration System, an application designed to manage student course registrations. The main file to run is `Registrationsystem.java`, located at `Student Course Registration/src/Registrationsystem.java`.

## Steps to Run the Student Course Registration System

Follow these steps to run the Student Course Registration System:

1. **Download the Source Code**: If you haven't already, download the source code for the Student Course Registration System from the project repository or source provided.

2. **Install Java**: Ensure you have Java installed on your system. You can check if Java is installed by opening a terminal/command prompt and running the following command:
   ```
   java -version
   ```

   If Java is not installed, download and install the latest version of Java from the official Oracle website (https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) or adopt an open-source version like OpenJDK.

3. **Compile the Code**: Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the directory where you downloaded the source code, specifically to the folder containing `Registrationsystem.java`. To compile the code, use the `javac` command followed by the path to `Registrationsystem.java`:
   ```
   javac "Student Course Registration/src/Registrationsystem.java"
   ```

   This command will compile the Java source code into bytecode.

4. **Run the Application**: After successful compilation, you can run the Student Course Registration System using the `java` command followed by the class name (without the `.java` extension):
   ```
   java "Student Course Registration/src/Registrationsystem"
   ```

   The application should now start, and you can interact with it through the command line or graphical user interface, depending on its implementation.

5. **Follow On-screen Instructions**: Depending on the Student Course Registration System's design, follow the on-screen instructions to use the application. This may involve registering students for courses, managing course enrollments, or performing other related tasks.

6. **Exit the Application**: To exit the application, typically, you can enter a specific command or close the application window, depending on its design.

7. **Review the Code**: For a deeper understanding of how the Student Course Registration System works, feel free to review the source code in `Registrationsystem.java` and any other relevant files in the project.

## System Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
- A compatible operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any issues during compilation or execution, ensure that you have followed the steps correctly and that your Java installation is up-to-date.
- Check for any error messages or exceptions provided in the terminal/command prompt for debugging purposes.
- Consult the project documentation or contact the project maintainer for further assistance if needed.

Enjoy using the Student Course Registration System!

**Note:** This README assumes that the Student Course Registration System is a command-line application. If it has a different user interface or requires additional dependencies, please refer to the specific instructions provided with the project.
